   - When should you use an agent vs. a simple model call?
   - What are the risks and considerations for production agents?

2. **Technical Questions:**
   - How does ADK simplify agent development?
   - What's the best way to handle tool integration?
   - How do agents decide which tools to use?
   - What patterns work best for multi-agent coordination?

3. **Practical Questions:**
   - What types of problems are well-suited for agents?
   - How would you apply this to your own projects?
   - What additional tools/capabilities would be useful?
